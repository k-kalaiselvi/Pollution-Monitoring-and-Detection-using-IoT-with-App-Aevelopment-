The primary objectives of the project are: 
 To develop a smart pollution monitoring system using Raspberry Pi 3B+ and multiple 
environmental sensors. 
 To calculate AQI based on sensor data and transmit it to a Firebase Realtime Database.

JavaScript for data visualization. 
 To implement a chatbot interface for user interaction and pollution-related queries.
